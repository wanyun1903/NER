He accused the bloc of levelling greater demands against London than other partners. He that the EU has granted long-term market access for securities clearing houses from the US but not for their UK counterparts even though they comply with the same rules.\nIn the text of a speech he was due to deliver on Wednesday, the banking chief said: \"The EU has argued it must better understand how the UK intends to amend or alter the rules going forwards.\n\"This is a standard that the EU holds no other country to and would, I suspect, not agree to be held to itself.\"\nReferring to the EU's demands, he said it is difficult to \"see beyond one of two ways of interpreting this statement, neither of which stands up to much scrutiny.\"\nHe added: \"We have an opportunity to move forward and rebuild our economies, post-COVID, supported by our financial systems.\n\u00a9 GETTY Bank of England Governor lashes out at EU after demanding too much from UK in finance feud \u00a9 GETTY brexit news latest \"Now is not the time to have a regional argument.\"\nHe said the UK should not be forced to follow the same rules for financial services as the EU and agreeing to not change rules in future would be \"unrealistic, dangerous and inconsistent with practice\".\nIn his annual Mansion House speech to the City of London, Mr Bailey said the UK should also be allowed to change rules independently, and agreeing to only follow EU rules would be \"rule-taking pure and simple\".\nHe added: \"It is not acceptable when UK rules govern a system 10 times the size of the UK GDP (gross domestic product) and is not the test up to now to assess equivalence.\"\n\u00a9 GETTY brexit bank of england news The Bank of England Governor also said a low-regulation financial system would not be in the UK's best interests.\nHis words were a slapdown to calls for a Singapore-style regime for banks.\nHe said: \"Let me be clear, none of this means that the UK should or will create a low-regulation, high-risk, anything goes financial centre and system.\n\u00a9 GETTY brexit news latest \u00a9 GETTY brexit bank of england news \"We have an overwhelming body of evidence that such an approach is not in our own interests, let alone anyone else's.\n\"That said, I believe we have a very bright future competing in global financial markets underpinned by strong and effective common global regulatory standards.\"\nHis warning comes just over a month after the UK exited the Brexit transition period.\nUK and EU counterparts are negotiating the terms of a memorandum of understanding over access for City institutions to European financial markets.\n\u00a9 EXPRESS Brexit end game Regulators are hoping to have a deal signed by next month.\nHowever, Brussels has suggested the UK must follow rules for a number of years without diverging.\nIn his speech, the banking chief pointed out that it was up to regulators to determine which rules can be considered equivalent - as happens in other nations - rather than just following rules to the letter.\nAsked whether the UK risks being cut off from the EU financial system, Mr Bailey said: \"I think that would be a mistake.\n\"It raises the cost of finance for everybody including the citizens of the EU.\n\u00a9 GETTY brexit bank of england news \"It will raise the cost of doing business in the EU, so I think it's a mistake.\"\nMr Bailey was appointed Bank of England Governor in December 2019.\nHe took over from Mark Carney in March of last year.\nMr Bailey previously served as chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the City watchdog.\nMicrosoft and partners may be compensated if you purchase something through recommended links in this article."}, "2": {"news": "Big Pharma\u2019s COVID Vaccine. Introduction\nThe plan to develop the Covid-19 vaccine is profit driven.\nThe US government had already ordered 100 million doses back in July 2020 and the EU is to purchase 300 million doses. It\u2019s Big Money for Big Pharma, generous payoffs to corrupt politicians, at the expense of tax payers. The objective is ultimately to make money, by vaccinating the entire planet of 7.8 billion people for SARS-CoV-2. The Covid vaccine in some cases envisages more than one shot. If this initiative were to go ahead as planned, it would be the largest vaccine project in World history and the biggest money making operation for Big Pharma.\nThe Second Wave of the pandemic commenced in October 2020. The Pfizer Moderna corona vaccine was launched in early November 2020.\nWorldwide, people are led to believe that the corona vaccine is a solution. And that \u201cnormality\u201d will then be restored.\nHow is it that a vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which under normal conditions would take years to develop, was promptly launched on the 9th of November?\nMoreover, the vaccine announced by Pfizer and Moderna is based on an experimental gene editing mRNA technology which has a bearing on the human genome. Coupled with the vaccine initiative is the development of a so-called digital passport which will be imposed on entire populations. (See analysis below).\nAnd why do we need a vaccine for Covid-19 when the WHO, the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) as well as numerous scientists have confirmed unequivocally that Covid-19 is \u201csimilar to seasonal influenza\u201d.( See our analysis in Chapter II).\nThe Drive to Develop a Corona Vaccine is Profit\nIt would appear that the standard lab tests using ferrets and mice will not be conducted.\n\u201cHuman tests began in late July and early August [2020]. Three months is unheard of for testing a new vaccine. Several years is the norm.\u201d\nThis caricature by Large + JIP\u00c9M explains our predicament:\nMouse No 1: \u201cAre You Going to get Vaccinated\u201d,\nMouse No. 2: Are You Crazy, They Haven\u2019t finished the Tests on Humans\u201d\nUn grand merci aux caricaturistes Large et JIP\u00c9M\nDr. Michael Yeadon, a former Vice President of Pfizer has taken a firm stance : \u201cAll vaccines against the SARS-COV-2 virus are by definition novel. No candidate vaccine has been\u2026 in development for more than a few months.\u201d:\n\u201cIf any such vaccine is approved for use under any circumstances that are not EXPLICITLY experimental, I believe that recipients are being misled to a criminal extent.\u201d\nIn early December, Dr Michael Yeadon together with Dr. Wolfgang Wodarg \u201c filed an application with the EMA , the European Medicine Agency responsible for EU-wide drug approval, for the immediate suspension of all SARS CoV 2 vaccine studies, in particular the BioNtech/Pfizer study on BNT162b (EudraCT number 2020-002641-42).\nIt is important to review the complex history of the novel vaccine. History of the SARS-CoV-2 Vaccine Project\nThere are many contradictions. The analysis below addresses the earlier stages of the vaccine project as well as the role of the 201 Simulation under the auspices of the John Hopkins School of Medicine held in New York on October 19, 2019.\nThe Covid vaccine is a multibillion dollar Big Pharma operation which will contribute to increasing the public debt of more than 150 national governments.\nSupported by the fear campaign, Money rather than Public Health is the driving force behind this initiative. The GSK-Pfizer Partnership Five months before the onset of the Covid-19 crisis, two of the largest Worldwide Pharma conglomerates decided to join hands in a strategic relationship. In August 2019, GSK confirmed the formation of a major partnership with Pfizer entitled the Consumer Health Joint Venture .\nWhile the relationship is said to be limited to \u201ctrusted consumer health brands\u201d, the agreement envisages joint financial procedures including joint multibillion dollar investment projects. While it does not constitute a merger, the GSK-Pfizer alliance implies selective integration and de facto collusion in many of the two companies\u2019 activities including the vaccine market. \u201c The completion of the joint venture with Pfizer marks the beginning of the next phase of our transformation of GSK. This is an important moment for the Group, laying the foundation for two great companies, one in Pharmaceuticals and Vaccines and one in Consumer Health.\u201d ( GSK , August 1, 2019, emphasis added) This GSK-Pfizer relationship also encompasses a network of partner pharmaceutical companies, research labs, virology institutes, military and biotech entities, etc. many of which are currently involved in the Covid vaccine initiative.\nAt present, a handful of multinational companies including GSK and Pfizer control 80% of the global vaccine market. Under the agreement between the two companies, GSK-Pfizer is slated to play a dominant and coordinated role in regards to the Covid-19 vaccine.\nThe October 2019 Coronavirus Event 201 Simulation Exercise\nThe coronavirus was initially named nCoV-19 by CEPI and the WHO: exactly the same name as that adopted in the WEF-Gates-John Hopkins Event 201 ( 2019-nCov ) pertaining to a coronavirus simulation exercise held in Baltimore in mid October 2019.\nThe Event 201 John Hopkins simulation addressed the development of an effective vaccine in response to millions of cases (in the October 2019 simulation) of the 2019 nCoV. The simulation announced a scenario in which the entire population of the planet would be affected: \u201cDuring the initial months of the pandemic, the cumulative number of cases [in the simulation] increases exponentially, doubling every week. And as the cases and deaths accumulate, the economic and societal consequences become increasingly severe.\u201d\nThe scenario ends at the 18-month point, with 65 million deaths. The pandemic is beginning to slow due to the decreasing number of susceptible people. The pandemic will continue at some rate until there is an effective vaccine or until 80-90 % of the global population has been exposed. From that point on, it is likely to be an endemic childhood disease.\nAccording to the WEF Video below, produced in relation to the 201 Simulation, \u201cwe ran a massive viral pandemic simulation.., 65 million deaths Worlwide.\u201d.\nSee also the analysis of F. William Engdahl on the 201 Simulation\nVideo Produced by the World Economic Forum in association with the 201 John Hopkins Simulation\nIronically, on January 30th 2020, the WHO defined the new virus as 2019-nCoV , i.e. the same name as that used in the 201 simulation in October 2019.\nIt was only later that Covid-19 was identified by the WHO not as a virus but as a disease: coronavirus disease (COVID-19), the Virus was identified as \u201csevere acute respiratory syndrome\u201d coronavirus 2 ( SARS-CoV-2 )\nTwo weeks after the virus had been formally identified by the People\u2019s Republic of China (Jan 7, 2020), a vaccine for the novel coronavirus was announced by CEPI at the Davos World Economic Forum, January 20-24, 2020.\nThe Central Role of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)\nThe lead entity for the novel coronavirus vaccine initiative is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) an organization sponsored and financed by the World Economic Forum (WEF) and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\nNote the chronology: The development of the 2019 nCoV vaccine was announced at the Davos World Economic Forum (WEF) a week prior to the official launching by the WHO of a Worldwide Public Health Emergency (January 30) at a time when the number of \u201cconfirmed cases\u201d Worldwide (outside China) was 83. ( see Chapter II)\nThe pandemic was launched by the WHO on March 11. And five days later, barely covered by the media, the first tests involving human volunteers were conducted by Moderna in Seattle on March 16.\nAccording to Richard Hatchett, CEO of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) the project to develop a vaccine commenced not only prior to the discovery and identification of the coronavirus (January 7, 2020) but several months prior to the October 2019 Scenario 201 simulation exercise.\n\u201cWe did that in the last year or so [early 2019] . \u2026 \u201d\n(scroll down for interview with Richard Hatchett)\nCEPI is seeking a \u201cmonopoly\u201d role in the vaccination business the objective of which is a \u201cglobal vaccine project\u201d, in partnership with a large number of \u201ccandidates\u201d.\nIt announced funding for its existing partnership with Inovio and The University of Queensland (Australia). In addition, CEPI confirmed (January 23, 2020) its contract with Moderna, Inc . and the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) headed by Dr. Anthony Fauci, who has been instrumental in waging the fear and panic campaign across America: \u201cTen Times Worse than Seasonal Flu\u201d. ( See WEF Video )\nCEPI was dealing simultaneously with several pharmaceutical companies. The Moderna- NIAID agreement was implemented. The mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was launched in the US in late November 2020.\nOn January 31st, 2020 the day following the WHO\u2019s official launching of the global public health emergency (PHEIC) and Trump\u2019s decision to curtail air travel with China, CEPI announced its partnership with CureVac AG , a German-based biopharmaceutical company.\nA few days later, in early February 2020, CEPI \u201cannounced that major vaccine manufacturer GSK would allow its proprietary adjuvants \u2014 compounds that boost the effectiveness of vaccines \u2014 to be used in the response\u201d. (The pandemic was officially launched on March 11).\nThere were many \u201cpotential vaccines in the pipeline\u201d with \u201cdozens of research groups around the world racing to create a vaccine against COVID-19\u201d. The COV-19 Global Vaccination Program\nCEPI (on behalf of Gates-WEF, which funded the 201 simulation exercise) is currently playing a key role in a large scale Worldwide vaccination program in partnership with biotech companies, Big Pharma, government agencies as well as university laboratories.\nThe foregoing statement by CEPI was made nearly two months prior to the official declaration of a pandemic on March 11. \u201cWe\u2019re having conversations with a broad array of potential partners\u201d. And critical to those conversations is: What\u2019s the plan to make very large quantities of vaccine within a time frame that is potentially relevant to what people seem to be increasingly certain will be a pandemic, if it isn\u2019t already there? \u2026\u201d [ Richard Hatchett, CEPI CEO in interview with stat.news.com]. \u2026\nThe underlying focus was to develop a global vaccine:\nAnd part of that was doing a global survey of manufacturing capacity to think about where we wanted to plant the manufacturing of any successful products we were able to bring forward.\nOf significance, Hatchett confirmed that the project to develop a vaccine commenced not only prior to the discovery and identification of the coronavirus (January 7, 2020) but several months prior to the October 2019 201 simulation exercise.\n\u201cWe did that in the last year or so . [early 2019]\u2026 We are using the information that we have collected and have that team now thinking about opportunities for scaling vaccines of various different types. That is a work in progress. For some of the technologies the tech transfer [to a manufacturer] may be something that could be done in a time frame that was pertinent to the epidemic, potentially.\nI think it is going to be really important to engage those folks who have access to really substantial production capacity. And having the big producers at the table \u2014 because of their depth, because of their experience, because of their internal resources \u2014 would be very, very important.\nThe candidate vaccines will be very, very quick. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of NIAID [who has been spreading panic on network TV], is out in public as saying he thinks the clinical trial for the Moderna vaccine may be as early as the spring. (emphasis added)\nWhat is now unfolding in real life is in some regards similar to the October 2019 201 Simulation exercise at John Hopkins.\nThe scenario is how to produce millions of vaccine shots on the presumption that the pandemic will spread Worldwide, and for that you need the Covid-19 \u201cpositive cases\u201d to go fly high.\nThe CEPI sponsored vaccine conglomerates had already planned their investments well in advance of the global Worldwide health emergency (PHEIC) (declared by the WHO on January 30, 2020):\nI [Hachett] think part of the general strategy is to have a large number of candidates. [and] you want to have enough candidates that at least some of them are moving rapidly through the process.\nAnd then for each candidate, you need to ask yourself the question: How do you produce that? \u2026 [And] how are you going to get to that point with production at a scale that is meaningful in the context of a disease that is going to infect the whole of society? (Interview conducted by Helen Branswell, statsnews, February 3, 2020)\nModerna Inc\nModerna Inc based in Seattle was one of the several candidates involved and supported by CEPI.\nModerna announced on February 24th the development of \u201can experimental mRNA COVID-19 vaccine, known as mRNA-1273\u2033. \u201c The initial batch of the vaccine has already been shipped to U.S. government researchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)\u201d headed by Dr. Antony Fauci.\nWhile Moderna Inc initially stated that the first clinical trials would commence in late April , tests involving human volunteers started in mid-March in Seattle: (bear in mind the pandemic was officially launched on March 11)\nResearchers in Seattle gave the first shot to the first person in a test of an experimental coronavirus vaccine Monday \u2014 leading off a worldwide hunt for protection even as the pandemic surges. \u2026\nSome of the study\u2019s carefully chosen healthy volunteers, ages 18 to 55, will get higher dosages than others to test how strong the inoculations should be. Scientists will check for any side effects and draw blood samples to test if the vaccine is revving up the immune system, looking for encouraging clues like the NIH earlier found in vaccinated mice.\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know whether this vaccine will induce an immune response, or whether it will be safe. That\u2019s why we\u2019re doing a trial,\u201d Jackson stressed. \u201cIt\u2019s not at the stage where it would be possible or prudent to give it to the general population.\u201d ( FOX news local) The Covid Vaccine and the ID2020 Digital Identity Platform While CEPI had announced the launching of a global vaccine at the Davos World Economic Forum, another important and related endeavor was underway. It\u2019s called the ID2020 Agenda , which, according to Peter Koenig constitutes \u201c an electronic ID program that uses generalized vaccination as a platform for digital identity\u201d.\n\u201cThe program harnesses existing birth registration and vaccination operations to provide newborns with a portable and persistent biometrically-linked digital identity\u201d. ( Peter Koenig, March 2020)\nThe founding Partners of ID2020 are Microsoft, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI) among others.\nIt is worth noting the timeline: T he ID2020 Alliance held their Summit in New York, entitled \u201cRising to the Good ID Challenge\u201d, on September 19, 2019, exactly one month prior to nCov-2019 simulation exercise entitled Event 201 at John Hopkins in New York:\nIs it just a coincidence that ID2020 is being rolled out at the onset of what the WHO calls a Pandemic? \u2013 Or is a pandemic needed to \u2018roll out\u2019 the multiple devastating programs of ID2020? ( Peter Koenig, March 2020)\nID2020 is part of a \u201cWorld Governance\u201d project which, if applied, would roll out the contours of what some analysts have described as a Global Police State encompassing through vaccination the personal details of several billion people Worldwide. According to Dr. David Martin (quoted by Makia Freeman) : \u201cThis is not a vaccine \u2026 using the term vaccine to sneak this thing under public health exemptions \u2026 This is a mRNA packaged in a fat envelope that is delivered to a cell. It is a medical device designed to stimulate the human cell into becoming a pathogen creator. It is not a vaccine! Vaccines actually are a legally defined term \u2026 under public health law \u2026 under CDC and FDA standards, and a vaccine specifically has to stimulate both an immunity within the person receiving it, but it also has to disrupt transmission.\nIn the Wake of the Lockdown. The Second Wave\nThe Second Wave: The fear campaign continues in the wake of the lockdown. A new lockdown is unfolding (December-January) in several countries.\nWill the hardships of the economic and social crisis (coupled with a fear campaign) encourage people to get vaccinated?\nTo implement the Global Vaccine, the propaganda campaign must continue. The Truth must be suppressed. These are their \u201cguidelines\u201d, which must be confronted and challenged.\nSeveral governments (aka corrupt politicians) including the US, UK, France, Germany, Canada as well as India have already provided the green light. Information and analysis on the features of the virus (similar to seasonal influential) is being suppressed by the media.\nWhile Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) has been used to treat patients in both Europe and North America, Big Pharma with the support of the governments is intent upon suppressing evidence on how COVID-19 can be cured, without the need of a vaccine. (See Chapter VI) The Covid Vaccine and \u201cHerd Immunity\u201d: Changing the Definitions\nHerd immunity is an important concept in medicine. According to Healthline:\n\u201cIt happens when so many people in a community become immune to an infectious disease that it stops the disease from spreading.\nThis can happen in two ways:\n1. Many people contract the disease and in time build up an immune response to it (natural immunity).\n2. Many people are vaccinated against the disease to achieve immunity.\nHerd immunity can work against the spread of some diseases. There are several reasons why it often works.\u201d (See Healthline)\nThe WHO has redefined herd immunity with a view to supporting the multibillion dollar Covid vaccine initiative:\nBelow (Left) is the official WHO definition (June 2020). And in November (Right) the WHO decided unilaterally to redefine a fundamental medical concept, focussing solely on the role of vaccination in achieving herd immunity.\nTo our knowledge, the peer reviewed definition of herd immunity has not changed.\nThe new \u201cdefinition\u201d of the WHO visibly serves the interests of Big Pharma. Flashback: The 2009 H1N1 Swine Flu Pandemic\nRemember the 2009 H1N1 \u201cpandemic\u201d when Obama\u2019s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology compared the H1N1 pandemic to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic while reassuring the public that the latter was more deadly. (CBC: Get swine flu vaccine ready: U.S. advisers). For further details see Michel Chossudovsky, August 2009 Study on H1N1 Pandemic )\nBased on incomplete and scanty data, the WHO Director General Margaret Chan predicted with authority that: \u201c as many as 2 billion people could become infected over the next two years \u2014 nearly one-third of the world population. \u201d (World Health Organization as reported by the Western media, July 2009).\nIt was a multibillion bonanza for Big Pharma supported by the WHO\u2019s Director-General Margaret Chan.\nIn a subsequent statement Dr. Chan confirmed that:\n\u201cVaccine makers could produce 4.9 billion pandemic flu shots per year in the best-case scenario\u201d, Margaret Chan, Director-General, World Health Organization (WHO) , quoted by Reuters, 21 July 2009).\n\u201c Swine flu could strike up to 40 percent of Americans over the next two years and as many as several hundred thousand could die if a vaccine campaign and other measures aren\u2019t successful.\u201d (Official Statement of Obama Administration, Associated Press, 24 July 2009).\nThere was no H1N1 pandemic affecting 2 billion people. Millions of doses of swine flu vaccine had been ordered by national governments from Big Pharma.\nMillions of vaccine doses were subsequently destroyed: a financial bonanza for Big Pharma, an expenditure crisis for national governments.\nThere was no investigation into who was behind this multibillion dollar fraud. Several critics said that the H1N1 Pandemic was \u201cFake\u201d\nThe Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE), a human rights watchdog, is publicly investigating the WHO\u2019s motives in declaring a pandemic. Indeed, the chairman of its influential health committee, epidemiologist Wolfgang Wodarg, has declared that the \u201cfalse pandemic\u201d is \u201cone of the greatest medicine scandals of the century.\u201d (Michael Fomento, Forbes , February 10, 2010)\nMichael Fomento concludes:\nEven within the agency, the director of the WHO Collaborating Center for Epidemiology in Munster, Germany, Dr. Ulrich Kiel, has essentially labeled the pandemic a hoax. \u201cWe are witnessing a gigantic misallocation of resources [$18 billion so far] in terms of public health,\u201d he said.\nThey\u2019re right. This wasn\u2019t merely overcautiousness or simple misjudgment. The pandemic declaration and all the Klaxon-ringing since reflect sheer dishonesty motivated not by medical concerns but political ones.\nUnquestionably, swine flu has proved to be vastly milder than ordinary seasonal flu. It kills at a third to a tenth the rate, according to U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates. Data from other countries like France and Japan indicate it\u2019s far tamer than that."}, "3": {"news": "The total solution to SARS-CoV 2 Antigen and Neutralizing Antibody Detection. February 10 17:33 2021 by admin As of February 9, 2021, there are more than 27 million confirmed new coronavirus infections worldwide, and the number of confirmed infections per day is still increasing at a rate of over 500,000. When will this war between humans and viruses end? In the face of powerful \u201cenemies\u201d, we are not afraid, because vaccines will become our powerful weapons. At present, many countries and regions around the world have carried out large-scale COVID-19 vaccination. The protective effect of the vaccine is to cause the body\u2019s immune response to produce neutralizing antibodies, which are protective antibodies that can bind to the virus and prevent the virus from binding to the receptor on the host cell. The traditional method for detecting neutralizing antibodies is a live virus titration and neutralization experiment, which has high risks, time-consuming, and complicated operations, which brings great inconvenience to large-scale population vaccination evaluation. Therefore, it is very meaningful to establish a method for rapid detection of neutralizing antibodies. Beijing Hotgen Biotech Co., Ltd. is a high-tech enterprise integrating R&D, production and sales. Based on advanced technology, it has developed various reagents and instruments for in vitro diagnostics. Regarding the new coronavirus, Hotgen Biotech provides a complete set of solutions from pathogen detection (nasopharyngeal swabs or saliva samples) to antibody detection and neutralizing antibody detection to meet the needs of epidemic prevention and control in various scenarios. New coronavirus neutralizing antibody detection kit (colloidal gold method), can detect the SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody rapidly. The kit uses a double antigen sandwich method, and the antigen is a highly specific receptor binding domain of the new coronavirus S protein(S-RBD), which can be used to detect total neutralizing antibodies produced by the human body, including IgA, IgM and IgG. No equipment is needed, and accurate test results can be obtained in 15 minutes. In addition, Hotgen Biotech also provides a neutralizing antibody detection kit based on the competition method, which uses magnetic particle chemiluminescence technology for a accurate results.

Bitcoin Ethereum News\nAfter recording yet another ATH on the charts, one well beyond $1,800, Ethereum currently has its eyes set on the $2,000-mark. While quite a few of its on-chain metrics are flashing positive signs, other noticeable concerns are creeping up as well. The culprit here, according to many, is a familiar foe (fee*). Source: Coinstats Ethereum registers high active addresses, large addresses\nTicking off some of its optimistic signs, according to CoinMetrics\u2019 latest report, Ethereum has been noting an increase in active addresses since the summer of June 2020, with the active addresses averaging between 500k-600k since January 2021. Source: CoinMetrics\nAdditionally, it was also identified that addresses holding significant amounts of ETH have registered constructive growth, with the number of addresses holding at least 10k ETH improving too. Now, with the introduction of CME ETH Futures, the mood around Ether is even more hopeful, however, its massive transaction fees deserve a lot of scrutiny too. How long can ETH maintain demand with such high fees?\nThat is the biggest issue for Ethereum right now. The high transaction fees are only due to the increasing demand for block space on its network. However, the fees are getting a little out of hand and climbing to new all-time highs too, even when compared to the highs registered during the DeFi season of August-September 2020.\nAccording to the aforementioned report,\n\u201cThe average ETH transaction fee reached $25.80, its highest level ever. The median transaction fee topped $14.32.\u201d Source: Glassnode\nFor context, Ethereum miners earned $3.74 million in a single hour last Friday, amassing over $55 million on the same day; another ATH. Small investors fear: Are other networks catching up?\nA major concern associated with large fees is that the median value of the transaction is currently going up and it may lead to smaller investors getting priced out of the network. The same goes for developers as if DeFi devs identify a better scalable network, they may jump ship if Ethereum is not able to solve its fee-situation.\nAccording to Ryan Selkis of Messari, EIP-1559 makes a compelling argument, but,\n\u201cIt also ignores the reality that Ethereum\u2019s scaling plans explicitly call for pushing transactions off of the expensive, gas-guzzling main chain and onto roll-up chains (or competitive layer 1s).\u201d\nNow, other competitive layers might be catching up already. Source: Trading View\nSome of the other primarily scalable layer 1 networks have completely outperformed Ethereum in 2021, networks including Cardano and other rising projects such as Polkadot and Avalanche. Here, it is important to note that the volume of activity witnessed by Ethereum is levels above these other projects, but their growing valuation suggests they have improving traction as well.\nEthereum might be on the clock to limit its transaction fees over the next few months, otherwise, these projects will only go on to gain even more traction.

The whole thing was a dog-and-pony show for Senate Republicans, who don't want to be caught looking supportive of an insurrection that failed. But they also don't want to offend their voters, who are still largely enthused about fascist insurrections and want to give Trump an A for effort. And so Republicans have settled on pretending they're springing Trump on a technicality \u2014 even though no one really believes such a technicality exists \u2014 in a pathetic bid to have it both ways. It felt like a waste of time because no one actually believes this trial is unconstitutional.\nBut there's one silver lining: The Democrats who are arguing the case as the House managers so thoroughly smoked Trump's defense that even Trump knows it. <p>Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland introduced a devastating video underscoring how Trump very deliberately sent an angry mob to storm the Capitol on Jan. 6 \u2014 telling them, \"<a href=\"https://digbysblog.net/2021/02/very-different-rules/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">you're allowed to go by very different rules</a>\" than the usual expectations of non-violence \u2014 and highlighting the horrors of the insurrection, which left five people dead and multiple police officers seriously injured. </p><p>Raskin ended the House managers' arguments with a terrifying description of his own experiences that day, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/02/10/jamie-raskin-won-trial-before-it-began/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">breaking into tears as he recounted the terror of his family members</a> who were visiting him following the funeral of his young son the day before. </p><p>In contrast, <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2021/02/09/trump-impeachment-lawyers-terrible-opening-argument-stuns-observers_partner/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trump's lawyers presented arguments that were equal parts smug and incoherent</a>. His first lawyer, Bruce Castor, condescendingly suggested that because people are understandably emotional about the insurrection their arguments are rendered irrational. It's an especially offensive argument to be made in defense of Trump, a man who is all id and no rationality. Castor's patronizing tone was made all the more annoying by the fact that his arguments were erratic and inconsistent nonsense. That's especially so compared to the devastating case made earlier in the afternoon <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/video/rep-neguse-defends-impeachment-trial-of-former-president-trump-as-constitutional-100758597703\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">by Rep.

There's no way to mount a convincing defense of Trump, <a href=\"https://www.justsecurity.org/74138/incitement-timeline-year-of-trumps-actions-leading-to-the-attack-on-the-capitol/\" target=\"_blank\">who spent months publicly inciting his followers to violence</a> in <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2020/11/02/trump-is-encouraging-anti-democratic-violence--but-dont-let-that-stop-you/\" target=\"_blank\">incredibly unsubtle ways</a>. But Trump, ever the believer in the magic of bullshit, clearly believes there's some way to spin this so he looks like the good guy. And why not? \"The Apprentice\" used TV stratagems to trick Americans into believing Trump was a successful businessman. He successfully bamboozled 74 million Americans into thinking he was qualified to be president. Why shouldn't he imagine that a little razzle-dazzle would work this time around?</p><p>In any world where Senate Republicans gave a crap about justice, rationality, good argumentation, or even reality, <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2021/02/10/trumps-lawyers-make-a-mockery-of-republican-senators-impeachment-trial-makes-gop-complicity-clear/\" target=\"_blank\">Trump's conviction would be a done deal</a>. Sadly, however, Republicans care for none of those values. Only one Republican, Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, was so embarrassed by how bad Trump's legal arguments were that <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/09/politics/six-republicans-vote-impeachment-trial/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">he switched from opposing the trial to supporting it</a>, joining only five other Republican senators who are acceding to reality on this one. The <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/media/impeachment-insurrection-video/2021/02/09/85463eb0-6b1f-11eb-ba56-d7e2c8defa31_story.html\" target=\"_blank\">other 44 Republicans spent the trial looking away</a>, doodling, faking interest in paperwork, or otherwise distracting themselves from their own choice to self-humiliate by pretending to believe a word of Trump's stupid defense arguments.<br/></p><p>Still, the former president's fury tells us something.</p><p>Trump is a profoundly stupid man, but he has an animalistic instinct for what makes for watchable TV. He clearly understands that the House managers trying the case are making him look bad. That is all the more reason why Democrats shouldn't want to hurry this trial along, <a href=\"https://www.salon.com/2021/02/09/democrats-drop-the-ball-on-trumps-second-impeachment-before-the-trial-even-begins/\" target=\"_blank\">but draw out the pain by calling witnesses</a>. Republicans are too cowardly to convict Trump. Democrats only have one chance of humiliating him so badly that he withdraws from politics for good. It very well might be a faint chance, but it's a better bet than expecting the majority of Republican senators to grow a spine and vote to convict. </p> Bob Brigham February 10, 2021\nRep.
